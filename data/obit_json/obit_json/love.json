self-help author and cuddly television guru who preached love with such single-minded fervor that he seemed unable to stop until he had hugged everyone in sight, died yesterday at his home in Lake Tahoe, Nev.", "He was 74 and known variously as Dr. Love, the Love Merchant and the Hug Doctor.", "Those who doubt the power of love must not have seen the phone lines light up when one of Dr. Buscaglia's love programs was being shown on public television during fund-raising weeks in the 1980's.", "They surely haven't seen the sales figures for his 15 love books, five of which were once on the New York Times best-seller list at the same time, and which together have sold more than 10 million copies.", "And they most certainly couldn't have attended one of his hundreds of love lectures, which typically started with an hourlong talk and ended with three hours of meeting, greeting and hugging members of the audience.", "But if his underlying message, that love conquers all, seems trite, Dr. Buscaglia, who frequently quoted Gore Vidal's remark that truth tends to become platitude, saw his mission not so much as telling people what they already knew but persuading them to act on it.", "His enthusiasm was so infectious and his own booming love so obviously genuine that when he asked parents in an audience how long it had been since they had told their children they loved them, he could tell by the perplexity on their faces that many would be making up for lost time when they got home.", "He wasn't a preacher seeking a congregation, he said, but a teacher trying to inspire people to be, and, yes, love, their  individual selves.", "Although he interlaced his philosophy with bits of pop psychology, as any of his fans could attest, Dr. Buscaglia's notions of love and his zest for life were both grounded in a sprawling, high-spirited Italian-American family so stereotypical that Dr. Buscaglia could bring tears to his eyes describing his mother singing at the stove or make his  mouth water simply by recalling spaghetti piled so high on the platter he could not see his sister across the dinner table.", "Then one of his prize students committed suicide and Dr. Buscaglia became so distraught that he began teaching an unofficial, noncredit course on life that he called Love 1.", "The result, ''Love,'' was published in 1972 and proved so popular that Dr. Buscaglia kept on writing, turning out such titles as ''Living, Loving and Learning'' (1982), ''Loving Each Other'' (1984), ''Born for Love'' (1992) and finally ''Leo Buscaglia's Love Cookbook'' (1994), written with Biba Caggiano and combining Dr. Buscaglia's lifelong love of people and food."]}, {"date": "06/14/1998", "gender": "male", "url":
