Paul Harkins, and replace him in June 1964 as a full four-star general.", "'' As head of the United States Military Assistance Command in Vietnam, General Westmoreland decided that far more American combat involvement was necessary to enable the struggling South Vietnamese military to resist the more disciplined and organized Communists.", "At the beginning of 1964, there were only 16,000 American military advisers in South Vietnam.", "But American casualties rapidly mounted into the thousands, at a time when the military draft meant that not only volunteers but young men off the streets could be sent to risk their lives in the jungles.", "Johnson announced he would not run again for office in 1968, and told the general he was appointing him Army chief of staff.", "'' When General Westmoreland was promoted to Army chief of staff, he was succeeded in the Vietnam command by Gen. Creighton W. Abrams Jr., a fellow member of the West Point class of 1936.", "He emphasized measures to strengthen the South Vietnamese military's capability to do battle, and deployed American forces around cities and in other populous areas.", "Gen.
