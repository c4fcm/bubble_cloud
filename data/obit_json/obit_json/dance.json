the greatest Classical choreographers of the 20th century and a former director of the Royal Ballet, died in his sleep Thursday night at his home in Sussex, England.", "Sir Frederick's death brings to a close an era in ballet shaped and presided over by three great innovators: George Balanchine, Antony Tudor and Sir Frederick.", "Mikhail Baryshnikov, director of American Ballet Theater, said yesterday: ''Working with Sir Fred was one of the most stimulating and inspiring times I have spent in the theater.", "'' Helped Define National Style Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, which has presented nine Ashton works, said: ''Sir Frederick Ashton enriched all our lives through his artistry and his humanity, The ballets he created and entrusted to us are a special treasure of the Joffrey repertoire.", "A versatile choreographer, he created ballets that drew on or evoked literary sources, that told stories and that were simple responses to a musical score.", "Only Sir Frederick, perhaps, could have made a narrative ballet about a turning point in a composer's career, as he did in the Chekhovian ''Enigma Variations,'' a 1968 work based on Sir Edward Elgar's score of the same name.", "In that ballet, he evoked not only the loneliness of genius but Elgar's friends and family and the mood of England at the turn of the century as well, and evoked them with such simple details as the eating of an apple and arrival of a telegram.", "''Only a poet could have conceived a ballet like 'Enigma,' '' David Vaughan, Sir Frederick's biographer, has written, ''and only the audacity of genius could have brought it off, this use of the resources of classic ballet to achieve a nobility of discourse and carry a weight of metaphor that many would say are beyond its scope - but it is his faith in those resources that makes Ashton a great poet.", "Marked by Pavlova and Duncan His interest in dance was stirred by a performance in Lima in 1917 by Anna Pavlova's ballet company and by an Isadora Duncan modern-dance program in London in 1921.", "His own dance career began in 1922 when he learned that Leonide Massine, one of the choreographers of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, was teaching in London.", "During the 20's, he studied with several teachers, the most important being Dame Marie Rambert, a former member of the Diaghilev Ballet who had settled in London.", "His first ballet, ''A Tragedy of Fashion,'' was a sketch presented in 1926 as part of ''Riverside Nights,'' a revue.", "Hoping to widen his knowledge of ballet and the world, he moved to Paris in 1928, where he joined the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, for which Bronislava Nijinska was choreographer.", "Back in England, Sir Frederick joined the company then known as the Vic-Wells Ballet, a troupe directed by Dame Ninette de Valois that later became the Sadler's Wells Ballet and, still later, the Royal Ballet.", "Mr. Somes said: ''Ninette would come along and say, 'Now, Fred, I want a romantic ballet at Christmas and then a 20-minute abstract ballet by Easter.", "That ballet was also a choreographic manifesto.", "Sir Frederick said in an interview, ''I didn't like the tendency English ballet was taking when I came back from the war,'' for he felt that ballets were becoming excessively literary.", "From the late 40's onward, he choreographed such works as ''Scenes de Ballet,'' ''Cinderella,'' ''Daphnis and Chloe,'' ''Ondine,'' ''La Fille Mal Gardee'' and ''Monotones.", "'' As guest choreographer for the New York City Ballet, he created ''Illuminations'' and ''Picnic at Tintagel,'' and he choreographed an evening-long ''Romeo and Juliet'' for the Royal Danish Ballet.", "A Work for Fonteyn and Nureyev Many of his ballets for the Royal Ballet starred Dame Margot Fonteyn, whose limpid dancing style made her ideally suited to his choreography.", "Sir Frederick, who was knighted in 1962, succeeded Dame Ninette as director of the Royal Ballet in 1963, and held that post until 1970.", "'' Then in 1971 he choreographed ''The Tales of Beatrix Potter,'' a dance film in which he played the comic role of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a hedgehog.", "A skilled character dancer, he was admired as the sorcerer in ''Firebird,'' the witch in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and one of the Ugly Sisters in his own ''Cinderella.", "After retiring as director of the Royal Ballet, Sir Frederick continued to choreograph, his creations ranging from brief divertissements to ''A Month in the Country,'' inspired by Turgenev.", "On April 19, 1983, his ''Varii Capricii'' had its world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House during an York engagement by the Royal Ballet.", "His last major works were ''La Chatte Metamorphosee en Femme,'' part of an homage to the Viennese dancer Fanny Elssler in 1985, and ''Fanfare for Elizabeth,'' for a tribute to the Queen Mother in 1986.", "Received Many Honors Among Sir Frederick's many honors were the Queen Elizabeth II Award from the Royal Academy of Dancing (1959), the Legion d'Honneur from France (1962), the Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog from Denmark (1964), the Dance Magazine Award (1970) and the Order of Merit (1977).", "Like George Balanchine, who was also born in 1904, Sir Frederick upheld the ideals of Classical dance."]}, {"date": "08/21/1988", "gender": "male", "url":
